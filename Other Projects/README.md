# Scripts

The "virutalDJ" program contains a script written for Autohotkey that takes a user inputted BPM and then triggers hotkeys in a time with that BPM converted to milliseconds. I created this program to display graphics I created in time with music for a "Virtual DJ" effect.

The "Javascript, Python, Java Projects" folder contains various different coding projects I made to learn how to better manipulate data and test the outcomes of my scripts. 

The folder "tShirtStore" contains a website constructed with Ruby on Rails that was intended to be used as a storefront to sell screenprinted t-shirts. It has a fully functioning cart system, user accounts along with admin controls, and paypal integration.

The folder "visualFilters" gives an example of the types of functions I wrote to create in-game effects on my art in the game 'No Longer Human'
