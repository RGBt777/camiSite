# Scripts

The "virutalDJ" program contains a script written for Autohotkey that takes a user inputted BPM and then triggers hotkeys in a time with that BPM converted to milliseconds. I created this program to display graphics I created in time with music for a "Virtual DJ" effect.

The "Javascript, Python, Java Projects" folder contains various different coding projects I made to learn how to better manipulate data and test the outcomes of my scripts.
