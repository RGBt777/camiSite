# Image Site
This is a project I created for my friends and I to be able to share images with each other in a digital space. The design of it is very minimal, as most of my effort went into learning Vue and as well as setting up a database for the site. As of now the site supports account creation (with password encryption), user pages, and user posts. In the future I would like to add admin tools, commenting, a chat room, and responsive web design for users on mobile devices.

Other projects of mine include writing scripts to save time in my artistic workflow, writing code to apply filters to art according to a set of functions I wrote, as well as writing several unit tests for scripts in Javascript, Python, and Java that ensure code is outputting properly. These are included in the "Scripts" folder, but are not related to the main website.

The folder "tShirtStore" contains a website constructed with Ruby on Rails that was intended to be used as a storefront to sell screenprinted t-shirts. It has a fully functioning cart system, user accounts along with admin controls, and paypal integration.
